Using promise based approach

//trying to upload a file

//based on an event 

// filechooser event


1) create a promise and telling that a filler chooser event will be recieved by you

const fileChooserPromise = page.waitForEvent("filechooser")


2) perform that operation which will trigger the filechooser event

await page.locator("#drag-drop-upload").click()

3) const fileChooser = await fileChooserPromise //it will give me the object of filechooser

4) fileChooser.setFiles(filePath)
